<h2 id="c1"><span class="small">NORRIS GEYSER BASIN</span></h2>
<p>The Norris Geyser Basin was named for
Philetus W. Norris who served as Yellowstone&rsquo;s
second superintendent from 1877
until 1882. Although he did not discover
it, his explorations and reports were
largely responsible for calling attention
to that area.</p>
<p>Norris is considered to be the hottest
and most active geyser basin in Yellowstone.
Here geysers and hot springs exhibit
greater change in activity over a
short span of time than elsewhere in the
park. It is not unusual for a new hot
spring to come into existence literally
overnight. The new feature may last for
just a few days or perhaps a month or
so; upon occasion some have endured
for many years.</p>
<p>Because of constant change in the thermal
features, the ground here is unstable and
hazardous in many locations. Therefore,
you are <b>required</b> to stay on designated
trails and boardwalks at all times. This
not only protects you from possible
serious burns but also helps preserve the
features as well. Remember also not to
throw any objects into thermal features.
Debris of any kind in a hot spring or geyser
could clog the vent and destroy the feature.
Because many scalding hot pools
and run-off channels are near trails and
boardwalks, pets are not permitted on
the trails.</p>
<p>The fact that thermal features change may
come as a surprise, but remember that
geysers, hot springs and other thermal
phenomena are subject to natural stresses
just like plant and animal communities.
Of course the changes in thermal activity
result from a different set of factors than
those affecting plants and animals. Can
you guess what they might be?</p>
<p>Shifts in the earth&rsquo;s crust (earthquakes)
result in movements along cracks and fissures
in the ground. These tremors usually
cause changes in the underground &ldquo;plumbing
systems&rdquo; of thermal features, thus altering
activity patterns. Look for signs of
recent activity variations as you walk
along the trails, or ask a naturalist if there
have been some recent changes.</p>
<p>As you explore, look closely at the often
intricate formations around the edges of
a few hot pools, geysers and in some
thermal runoff channels. You will notice
a mineral called sinter or geyserite (a form
of silicon dioxide, SiO&#8322;) being deposited
like tiny spines. These rather prickly formations
result when geyserite is deposited
from slightly acid water, a characteristic
of most thermal water in the Norris area.
This is in contrast to the bead-like structures
that result when geyserite forms from
slightly alkaline water found in thermal
features in the Old Faithful area.</p>
<p>Notice too the variety of colors staining
the basins. The refraction (breaking up) of
light, mineral deposits and living organisms,
algae and bacteria, all add their hues.
The assortment of colors reflects variations
in water temperature and chemistry.</p>
<p>As you enjoy your walk remember that
Norris is a great natural preserve where
nature is constantly at work designing and
redesigning one of its most unusual displays.
We are only visitors here and must
not spoil it in any way. It also serves as a
great natural research laboratory where
scientists from all over the world learn
more about geothermal energy. Help us
preserve this unique area so that the next
generation and those who follow can come
and enjoy it in the same grandeur you did.</p>
<p>The Norris Geyser Basin is made up of two
or more less separate areas called Porcelain
Basin and Back Basin. Both basins
are served by trails which begin at the
Norris Museum and are shown on <a href="#fig1">this map</a>.
The following briefly describes a
few features in each.</p>
<h2 id="c2"><span class="small">THERMAL FEATURES IN PORCELAIN BASIN</span></h2>
<p><span class="ss">VALENTINE GEYSER</span>&mdash;Located at the base
of a large pear-shaped alcove, Valentine
is a typical cone type geyser that first
erupted on Valentine&rsquo;s Day, 1907. Its activity
has varied considerably&mdash;being dormant
some seasons, erratic during others,
yet showing a high degree of regularity
at times. During the past several seasons,
it has erupted from a minimum of once
every two days to a maximum of once a
day. An eruption lasts 5-7 minutes and
reaches a height of 20-50 feet (6-15 m.)
above the seven foot cone. The eruption is
followed by a steam phase lasting an hour.</p>
<p><span class="ss">LEDGE GEYSER</span>&mdash;The largest geyser in the
Porcelain Basin, changed dramatically after
an earthquake that occurred June 30,
1975. In 1974 it had been erupting about
twice a day, but after the quake Ledge was
dormant for nearly two years. Then during
the summer of 1977 it had but two eruptions.
Check the prediction board at the
museum to see if Ledge Geyser is active
this year.</p>
<p><span class="ss">AFRICA GEYSER</span>&mdash;named for the spring
that preceded it which was roughly the
shape of the continent. The spring became
a geyser in February of 1971. At first it was
intermittent but as time passed the periods
between eruptions grew shorter until it became
a constant geyser. In 1977 it was
always powerful&mdash;sometimes emitting
a mixture of steam and water; other times
just steam.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_2">2</div>
<p><span class="ss">THE WHIRLIGIGS AND CONSTANT GEYSERS</span>&mdash;these
three features seem to be interconnected.
Constant Geyser, dormant
for several years, reactivated in the early
&rsquo;70&rsquo;s and now erupts up to 30 feet (9 m.)
once or twice an hour; often prior to an
eruption of one of the Whirligigs. In recent
years, Big and Little Whirligig have traded
active periods. When one is more active,
the other is less. Watch for the 15 foot
(4 m.) angled plume from Little Whirligig&rsquo;s
orange vent or listen to the distinctive
chugging produced during Big Whirligig&rsquo;s
splashing eruption. As with many geysers,
the water level rises in these pools
prior to an eruption.</p>
<p><span class="ss">EBONY AND BEAR DEN GEYSERS</span>&mdash;are
another set of related features. In the &rsquo;60&rsquo;s
Bear Den Geyser first appeared and as it
increased in activity, Ebony Geyser became
dormant. Today Bear Den Geyser
erupts in bursts, arcing up to 40 feet (12 m.)
from the den-like vent, four to six times
daily. The death of Ebony Geyser may have
been hastened by objects thrown into its
vent by thoughtless visitors. This debris is
cemented into place by the silica deposited
from the water, choking off the vent.
Minute Geyser in the Back Basin may have
suffered a similar fate.</p>
<h2 id="c3"><span class="small">THERMAL FEATURES IN BACK BASIN</span></h2>
<p><span class="ss">EMERALD SPRING</span>&mdash;The colors in and
around thermal features are often created
by several kinds of algae that grow in hot
water. However, the deep green color of
this spring is a result of a combination of
the yellow color from the sulphur lining
the edge of the pool with the blue that is
refracted (&ldquo;scattered&rdquo;) from the clear
water in the pool. The bowl of this feature
is about 27 feet (8 m.) deep and the temperature
normally varies between 194 and
200 degrees F. (90-93&deg; C.)</p>
<p><span class="ss">STEAMBOAT GEYSER</span>&mdash;The world&rsquo;s largest
geyser, Steamboat has eruptions of more
than 300 feet (91 meters). It was largely
dormant for nine years, then startled observers
in March 1978 with a full-scale
eruption. The water phase lasted approximately
20 minutes, followed by bellowing
steam for over 40 hours. This spectacular
display inundated the immediate area. At
this writing, March 30, 1978, it is not
known if Steamboat&rsquo;s eruptions will follow
any pattern. Between 1961 and March
1969, it had a total of 103 major eruptions,
none of which could be predicted. You
can still see the effects of downpouring
water on the landscape which killed trees
and scoured away soil. The nine-year respite
allowed new lodgepole pines to gain
a foothold. We hope you are fortunate
enough to witness Steamboat Geyser and
share in the excitement. Remember&mdash;protect
camera and eye glass lenses from the
spray as it can scratch glass after drying.</p>
<p><span class="ss">CISTERN SPRING</span>&mdash;In 1966 this feature
changed from a grayish-black color to its
present brilliant blue. Concurrent with this
the overflow increased killing many trees
near the spring. Since then a silica terrace
has rapidly built up. When Steamboat had
a major eruption the water level in Cistern
dropped 4-8 feet, (1.2-2.4 m.) with a corresponding
drop in water temperature of
around 60 degrees F. This seems to indicate
some connection between the two features.
Whether or not the increased water
output of Cistern has resulted in the decline
of Steamboat is still unknown.</p>
<p><span class="ss">ECHINUS GEYSER</span> (&#275;-k&#299;&prime;-n&#365;s)&mdash;although not
as well known as some other geysers,
erupts in a display that surpasses many of
them. The name comes from the sinter
spine-covered rocks surrounding the pool
which bear a fanciful resemblance to spiny
sea urchins. <i>Echinus</i> was the Greek name
for these tide-pool dwellers. Stop and
watch the water fill the basin and begin
to boil. Soon it will be propelled skyward
in great explosive bursts of steam and water,
some reaching heights of over 75 feet
(23 m.). Usually the eruptions last three
to six minutes but in 1977 Echinus was
erupting for up to twelve minutes. After
erupting the pool drains and begins to
refill. Intervals between eruptions may be
as short as 45 minutes or better than 75
minutes. Listen for the peculiar gurgling
sound produced as the vent drains after
each eruption.</p>
<p><span class="ss">VIXEN GEYSER</span>&mdash;Although its usual eruptions
are small compared to others (5-15
feet every few minutes), the geyser is
unique in that water comes from a circular
tub-like vent. During normal activity little
water is ejected. Occasionally Vixen may
have major eruptions of considerable
water, lasting 5 to 50 minutes and playing
up to 30 feet. Listen for the peculiar gurgling
sound produced as the vent drains
after each eruption.</p>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
This website includes information about Project Gutenberg&#8482;,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
